So what are your plans for this weekend?,I dont know do you want to get together or something?
SHow about going to see a movie?,That sounds like a good idea Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand
It is fine with me Where do you want to meet?,Lets meet at Pizza House I have not gone there for a long time
Good idea again I heard they just came up with a new pizza, It should be good because Pizza House always has the best pizza in town
When should we meet?,Well the movie is shown at 2 PM to 4 PM
Why dont we go to the 2 PM show?, We can meet at Pizza House at noon 
That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza,My cousin is in town Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone
Yes bring her along, you met her at Saras high school graduation party two years ago
I do not quite remember her What does she look like?,She has blond hair she is kind of slender and she is about your height
She wears eyeglasses right?,Yes and she was playing the piano off and on during the party
I remember her now Yes do bring her along, She is such a nice person and funny too
sure she can join us,She will be happy to meet you again
