SHow about going to see a movie?,That sounds like a good idea Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand
It is fine with me Where do you want to meet?,Lets meet at Pizza House I have not gone there for a long time
Good idea again I heard they just came up with a new pizza, It should be good because Pizza House always has the best pizza in town
When should we meet?,Well the movie is shown at 2 PM to 4 PM
Why dont we go to the 2 PM show?, We can meet at Pizza House at noon 
That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza,My cousin is in town Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone
Yes bring her along, you met her at Saras high school graduation party two years ago
I do not quite remember her What does she look like?,She has blond hair she is kind of slender and she is about your height

What is she doing these days?,She graduated last June and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins
What grade is she going to teach?,She will teach kindergarten She loves working with kids and she always has such a good rapport with them
Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long
I think she will do fine, She knows how to handle young children
I think the first few weeks will be tough However once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten
You are right, The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with
There are so many new things for them to do at school too, They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do 
yeah, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff
Maybe we can ask to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween,Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie What do you think?
I will talk to her I think she will like that,It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes
I know a good store for crafts It always carries a variety of things,you can find almost anything there?
yes,its not far away from Cinema then
I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue?
Aha We can even walk over there,So we plan to meet for pizza at noon 
go to the movies at two, and shoping afterward Right?
Yes,greate
