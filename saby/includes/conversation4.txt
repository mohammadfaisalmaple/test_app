Maybe we can ask to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween,Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie What do you think?
I will talk to her I think she will like that,It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes
I know a good store for crafts It always carries a variety of things,you can find almost anything there?

Aha We can even walk over there,So we plan to meet for pizza at noon 
go to the movies at two, and shoping afterward Right?
