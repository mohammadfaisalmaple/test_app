What is she doing these days?,She graduated last June and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins
What grade is she going to teach?,She will teach kindergarten She loves working with kids and she always has such a good rapport with them
Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long
I think she will do fine, She knows how to handle young children
I think the first few weeks will be tough However once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten
You are right, The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with
There are so many new things for them to do at school too, They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do 
yeah, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff
